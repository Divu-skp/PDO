# AI Disease Prediction Model

Welcome to the AI Disease Prediction Model repository! This project uses machine learning techniques to predict potential disease outbreaks. By analyzing historical data and other environmental factors, the model helps in early detection and better responses to prevent or mitigate outbreaks.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The AI Disease Prediction Model aims to predict the likelihood of disease outbreaks by analyzing a variety of factors, including historical outbreak data, environmental conditions, and relevant features. This tool can significantly aid in disease management and public health response strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales data, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train on historical disease data.
- **Prediction**: Forecasts potential future disease outbreaks.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in the project:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` - Numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning algorithms
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `tensorflow` - For potential deep learning model implementations

## 📥 Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Divu-skp/PDO.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PDO
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ⚙️ Usage
1. **Import the necessary modules** in your Python script:

    ```python
    from disease_prediction_model import predict_disease
    ```

2. **Load your dataset** and train the model:

    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")
    model = train_model(data)
    ```

3. **Make predictions** using the trained model:

    ```python
    predictions = model.predict(new_data)
    ```

## 🔍 Example

Here’s an example to demonstrate how to load data, train the model, and make predictions:

```python
import pandas as pd
from disease_prediction_model import train_model, predict_disease

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("disease_data.csv")

# Train the model
model = train_model(data)

# Predict disease outbreak
new_data = pd.DataFrame({"feature1": [value1], "feature2": [value2]})
prediction = predict_disease(model, new_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
```
## 📊 Evaluation
Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted outcomes.
- Precision: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
- Recall: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
